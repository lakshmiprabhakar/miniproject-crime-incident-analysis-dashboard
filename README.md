# MiniProject-AI-DRIVEN DATA ANALYTICS
The Crime Incident Analysis Dashboard – 2025 focuses on analyzing crime incidents recorded during the year 2025. The raw dataset was first cleaned and organized using Excel to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and structure the data properly for analysis. After preprocessing, the cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to build an interactive and meaningful dashboard.

The report presents crime patterns through clear visualizations such as KPI summary cards, offense type distribution, monthly crime trends, time shift analysis, and location-based crime distribution. DAX measures were created to calculate total incidents, distinct crime categories, district-level analysis, and percentage contributions.

Interactive slicers allow filtering by district, offense type, time shift, and date. A separate drillthrough page provides deeper analysis at district and neighborhood levels using hierarchical exploration (District → Ward → Neighborhood). Navigation buttons were added to improve user experience and enable smooth movement between pages.

The objective of the dashboard is to transform raw crime data into structured, interactive insights that highlight patterns, high-incident areas, and time-based trends. The project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, DAX calculations, report design, drillthrough functionality, and data storytelling using Power BI.
